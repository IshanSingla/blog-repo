## ðŸ“š Blogs

### 1. [Personalized Course Recommendation using RAG](./personalized-course-recommendation-rag/README.md)

> This blog explores how to build a personalized course recommendation system using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.
> We dive into how to semantically index course materials, retrieve relevant data based on user profiles, and generate tailored suggestions using LLMs like **OpenAI/GPT** or **LLaMA**.

**Key Topics:**

* Vector embeddings & semantic search
* User profiling and context-aware recommendations
* LLM integration with real-time retrieval
* Practical RAG system architecture

### 2. [Enterprise LLM Chatbot Architecture â€“ Best Practices](./enterprise-llm-chatbot-architecture-best-practices/README.md)

> This blog covers **architectural best practices** for building scalable, enterprise-grade **LLM-based chatbots**.
> We go beyond basic chat interfaces and dive into **reliability, observability, real-time streaming**, and **MLOps** for deployment.

**Key Topics:**

* Event-driven architecture with Kafka
* Streaming responses using SSE/WebSockets
* ELK for observability & logging
* Separation of frontend (Next.js), backend (NestJS), and AI layer (Python)
* Security, tokenization, and context management

### 3. [Is Next.js Still Developer-Friendly in 2025? Exploring Issues, Vercel Monopoly, Migrations, and the Upcoming Next.js 16](./is-nextjs-still-developer-friendly-in-2025/README.md)

> Dive into the debates surrounding **Next.js in 2025** â€” from growing complexity and **Vercel's ecosystem dominance** to real-world migrations and previews of **Next.js 16** at the upcoming conference.
> This piece analyzes whether Next.js still deserves its developer-friendly reputation or if alternatives like Remix, Astro, and SvelteKit are taking the lead.

**Key Topics:**

* Next.js complexity & breaking changes
* Vercelâ€™s monopoly in frontend, cloud, and AI tools
* i18n, routing, and authentication pain points
* Real-world migrations (ChatGPT, Northflank, etc.)
* Next.js 16 and the future of the framework
